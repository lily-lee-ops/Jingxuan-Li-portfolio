# About me
Hello! I’m Jingxuan Li, a passionate data analytics enthusiast currently pursuing my Master’s degree in Information Systems Management with a focus on Business Intelligence and Data Analytics at Carnegie Mellon University, set to graduate in December 2025.

My journey in data began at the college. I dove deep into real-world projects in competition, such as supermarket promotion analysis using Python, which fueled my interest in harnessing data for impactful decision-making. Besides, I’ve gained hands-on experience through internships at Xiaohongshu and OPPO, optimizing product strategies and conducting A/B testing to enhance user experience.

When I’m not analyzing data, I enjoy practicing yoga, baking, and hiking. I’m excited to continue exploring the intersection of data science and business while enhancing my data skills in SQL, Python, and Tableau.

# What I hope to learn
- Dealing with challenges in real data modeling or data analysis
- Collaborative problem solving in team environment
- Data visualization with AI tools
