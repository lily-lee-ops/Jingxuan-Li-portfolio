# The final data story

[Data Story with American Food Import](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/americas-global-plate-the-story-of-u-s-food-imports/index.html)

# Changes made since Part II
Improve the color setting for the trend line visulization.
Adjust the width and length of the visulization diagrams.
Add filter choice to increase the interaction and show more information.

## The audience
General Public: 
Citizens interested in understanding global food systems, food security, and international trade relationships. This audience needs accessible visualizations with clear explanations that avoid industry jargon and provide relevant context.

## Final design decisions
Throughout the development process, I made several key design decisions to enhance both the analytical value and accessibility of my visualizations:

Color Strategy:

Initially used a wide color palette that interview participants found confusing
Revised to use a consistent color scheme across visualizations with better distinction between categories
Implemented colorblind-friendly options after learning one interview participant had color vision deficiency


Data Aggregation Levels:

Redesigned to show primary categories with drill-down capabilities for details
Balanced information density with clarity based on feedback about cognitive overload


Interactive Elements:

Added time-period filters across visualizations after all three interviewees requested this feature
Created guided narrative options for users less familiar with food trade terminology


## AI acknowledgements
Use Claude to check where to improve in the Tableau data visulization.

# Final thoughts
Excited about how to create the story and how to create corresponding data visulizations. Whether the visulizations can adapt to my story? Should my story change because I cannot create the proper graphs? How to keep balance between a simplified visulizations and the story I want to tell and the information I would like to convey.
